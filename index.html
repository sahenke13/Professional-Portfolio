      <p>I am an  innovative and curious Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for creating in both the digital and physical realms.  I am a  strong team player with great technical communication skills, developed from years of technical sales success. I have  an engineering background including a Bachelor of Science from the University of Minnesota, and enrollment/completion of the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through the University of Minnesota.  I am proficient at using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, command line, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Java, Git and GitHub,  and I am always eager to learn more.</p>

      <p>My passion for learning, creating and collaborating towards a common goal has driven my prior professional success, and it is what drives me as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
      
      <p>When I am not working on developing my coding craft, you can find me at the wood shop building some crafts or enjoy the great outdoors.</p>
