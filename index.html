      <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a natural curiosity and desire to create within both the digital and physical realms. A strong team player, I pride myself on my ability to effectively communicate technical concepts across a variety of skill levels, which is something I developed from my years within a technical sales and support role.</p>

      <p>I have a civil engineering background including a Bachelor of Science from the University of Minnesota, and Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through the University of Minnesota (program to be completed in December 2018). Additionally, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, command line, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Java, Git and GitHub, and I am always eager to learn more.</p>
      
      <p>When I am not working on further enhancing my coding craft, you can find me in the wood shop, designing and building functional home design products or in nature, enjoying the great outdoors.</p>
